#monitor specific devices
# You can specify which devices should get monitored by the plugin via environment 
# variables. The variables are mutually exclusive and should contain a comma-separated 
# list of device names. Partial names (e.g. 'sd' or 'dm-') are okay.
# LVM volumes can be filtered either by their canonical names or their internal 
# device-mapper based names (e.g. 'dm-3', see dmsetup(8) for further information).
